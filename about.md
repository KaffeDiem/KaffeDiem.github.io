This page is designed to help me setting up my Mac OS whenever I do a clean
install. Be free to use this information however you want. 

### Applications

Most applications can be installed trough *Homebrew* which is the package manager
for Mac OS.

Downloading and installing brew should be the first thing you do as you do
a clean install or get a new pc.
