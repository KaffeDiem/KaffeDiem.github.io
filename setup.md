This page is made for my own reference on setting up a clean install of Mac OS.

Use this information however you would like.

### Package Manager

The only real choice for a package manager on Mac OS is *Homebrew*. Homebrew allows
you to install applications and command-line-interface (CLI) tools with
a simple command. 

Download and install Homebrew from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)

### Installing applications with Homebrew

To install applications with a user interface (UI) with brew use 

```
$ brew cask install <application>
```

And to install CLI tools

```
$ brew install <cli tool>
```

It is also possible to search for applications with 

```
$Â brew search <application>
```
