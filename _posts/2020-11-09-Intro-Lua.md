title: Löve2d, getting started
---

This is supposed to be a short introduction to the bare minimum of getting
a Löve2d game up and running. First and foremost, you should follow the
[getting started](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) page on love2d.org.
The wiki-page will be a walktrough to get up and running very quickly on the 
major platforms. Also, the wiki page is very well documented and is a great
place to find information on specific functions. 

### Bare minimum

All of your games should consist of, at least, the three following functions. 
```lua
function love.load()
end

function love.update(dt)
end

function love.draw()
end
```

The `love.load()` function handles all the initial loading, when the game is
run. In this function you should be loading your images, audio files and
setting initial values for players, as well as other objects. `love.load()` is
only called once as the very first function.

In `love.update()` all updates are handled in ticks. If your game is running at
30 frames per second (FPS), this function is called 30 times per second! Here
we register things like keyboard inputs and movement. 

`love.draw()` handles all the drawing. This is done sequentially, which means
that the first function called to be drawn will be on the bottom 'layer'. As an
example you could call `player:draw()` on the first line, in the scope of
`love.draw()`, and on the line afterwards have `enemy:draw()`. If those to were
to overlap, the enemy would be on top.

### Drawing a rectangle 

Let us draw something onto the screen! If you followed the [getting started](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) link from above, you should have done this by now. 

We will be drawing a rectangle with `love.graphics.rectangle(mode, x, y, width,
height)`, all values are in pixels and drawing is done from the upper left
corner. *Notice* how things are growing downwards. This is because the Y-axis
is flipped. The bigger the Y-value, the further towards the bottom.

Putting it all together we have
```lua
function love.load()
end

function love.update(dt)
end

function love.draw()
  love.graphics.rectangle("fill", 20, 20, 100, 100)
end
```

Which you can then run by navigating to the src-folder and run `$ love .`

Notice how the square has an upper left corner drawn at the point (20, 20). It
then 'grows' 100 pixels in the X- and Y-axis.

### Making the rectangle move 

Taking things a bit further, we want to make this rectangle move. Take a look
at the following program.
```lua
rectangle = {x = 20, y = 20}

function love.load()
end

function love.update(dt)
  if love.keyboard.isDown("down") then
    rectangle.y = rectangle.y + 5
  end
  if love.keyboard.isDown("up") then
    rectangle.y = rectangle.y - 5
  end
end

function love.draw()
  love.graphics.rectangle("fill", rectangle.x, rectangle.y, 100, 100)
end
```
Quite a few things are happing here. First we introduce a global *table*,
`rectangle = {}`, which is accessible by all other functions. See how both
`love.update` and `love.draw` is accessing the `rectangle` table?

We are also calling `love.keyboard.isDown(key)` in the update function. This
function returns a boolean if *key* is down. Check out the [wiki page](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.keyboard.isDown) for way
more information on the `isDown()` function.

By running above code you should get the exact same square as before, with the
exception that it is moveable with the arrow keys!
