title: Remarkable 2 from a student perspective
---

The Remarkable 2 has been out for quite a while and in my possesion for more
then 3 months. Here are my perpective on a few quality-of-life improvements,
which are quite easy to install yourself. 

### Changing the lockscreen image

One thing that the reMarkable team should have included in the desktop software
is a way to change the lockscreen wallpaper. However, this is quite easy to do
yourself. 

##### Method 1: Using Cyberduck

Cyberduck is an application that connects to servers or the cloud using
different protocols. It also suppports SSH which is what we can access the
reMarkable 2 with wirelessly. [Download Cyberduck from here](https://cyberduck.io).

For Cyberduck to know what device to connect to it will need an IP address. The
IP address for the reMarkable 2, as well as the password, can be found under
´Settings -> Help -> Copyrights and licenses´.

See the IP and password at the bottom of the page? We need that.

### Installing ddvk mods

The ddvk mods adds a loft of improvements to the original software. It allows
you to quickly change between recently opened files and adds some useful
getures. 

Take a look at the [Github page](https://github.com/ddvk/remarkable-hacks) for a comprehensive list of features.

The install instructions may not be intuitively clear
