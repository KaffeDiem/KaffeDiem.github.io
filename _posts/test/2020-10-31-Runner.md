title: First Löve2d game!
---

I recently finished up my very first Löve2d game.
It is incredibly easy to get up and running. Here is a small gif

It is inspired by Flappy Bird, which we all know by now. 
I am excited to getting started on working on more!


I cannot recommend getting into Löve2d enough. It is very intuitive.
